1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)

The population size was 500, vaccinated percentage was .7, the virus was ebola, mortality rate was .3, and the reproductive rate was .2

2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

30 percent of the population burned out.

3. What percentage of the population died from the virus?

13 percent of people died 

4. Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, 
how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?

435 people were saved from dying. 350 people were vaccinated at the beginning of the population. The total amount of vaccinated people was 435
at the end of the simulation. That means it took 85 interactions to save the extra 85 people.
